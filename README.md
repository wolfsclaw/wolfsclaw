How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How you interpret something in your mind and how the customer interprets what they want in their mind are two different things.  Understanding where the customer is coming from and their vision is important in helping to interpret their needs.  Creating the user stories helps to put your thoughts and ideas into writing, so you can understand what the customer's needs are.  This will help you to understand what the customer's vision is.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs from the mindset of what the customer's needs and expectation are.  Without that understanding, you are taking a risk of putting together a project that the customer hates and all the work you have just done has been for nothing.  For me kanban is the most efficient.  Having that workboard with notes and what needs to be done, helps stay focused on completing the project that we are working on.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communication is key to being a good team member.  You must remember that people are not mind readers, and can't know what you are thinking.  You must be able to relate your thoughts and ideas in an open forum without fear of reprisal.  Also, having a good work ethic is paramount to a successful career.  You want to let your team know that you are going to go the extra mile to ensure that the work is done to the standards that the customer has asked for.
